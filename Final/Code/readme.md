1) The “nanotech_patents.py” code identifies patents with nano-technology words in the following the methodology described in our paper.

2) The “citation_gen_and_eval.py” code takes in the patents selected related to the nanotechnology (with the fields organized and joined in BigQuery then downloaded as a csv file) and performs the analysis described before outputting accuracy and Mean Average Precision.

3) The file “extra.ipynb” has the code to create graphs as well as calculate some summary statistics used.
